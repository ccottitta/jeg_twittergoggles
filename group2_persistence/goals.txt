Data Persistence
Your main goal is to implement the database schema and provide getter and setter methods in PhP to support the job table; and getter methods to support the tweet, hashtag, mention, and URL tables.  


Input - A database schema.  It is advisable to start with the schema provided in the Github repository and refine as needed.  For example the “_archive” and “_stage” are not required.


Connection Point - Tables to support researcher collaboration do not yet exist in the schema, so you should work with “Researcher Collaboration” to define and implement these tables in this round.


Output - A populated database schema.


create getter and setter methods for the various tables
aka write the PHP that will “SELECT FROM” and “INSERT INTO” etc for the various tables
right now you do not need to create text fields or any sort of front end interface, just provide some sort of way to test that what we’ve created works


TODO:


create new .sql file that contains only the tables we need
        - the 5 listed above, none of the ones with _ in them
collaborate with research team to figure out what tables they are creating, add them to schema
check php.net on how to incorporate the sociotechnical.ischool.drexel.edu database into our code
        - should just be an extra parameter in db_connect (‘     ‘,’    ‘,’    ‘)   ???

Sprint 2 Goals


1) Make proper GET and SET functions for usage by the Collection team
Example: 


function getHashTags($specificHashTag) {
        // Query db for $hashtags
        // return array of data
}


function setHashTag($hashtags) {
        // Query db to INSERT hash tag
}


2) Connect to the database with PHP and MySQL, eliminating dependence on MySQL Workbench.
