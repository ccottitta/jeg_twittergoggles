There is now a table that tracks changes to the job table.  There is proof that it works if you look in the xgroup schema in MySQL Workbench because the job table has a trigger attached to it called Update_Data and the job_tracking table has one row that tracks the changes made to the state change made on a job.  In this will help on the admin page because functions can be successfully created that will allow users to change the state and zombie_head of a given job and the changes will be tracked in this new table.
