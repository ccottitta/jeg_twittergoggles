\f0\fs24 \cf0 Reporting Read Me\
\
In order to deploy and use the Reporting portion of this project, you must first download all files within the folders. The form.html page is the central hub that takes user input and then links to the corresponding .php page based on which submit button is pressed. If the user selects one of the drop-down menu options at the top of the page and presses that submit button, the runtopscript.php file is run. If the user chooses to search by Job ID and presses that submit button, the run script.php file is run. Finally, if the user decides to search by hashtags, mentions, or general text strings, the searchbyqueryscript.php file is run. The way these .php files work is that they establish a connection with the database, creates a query that uses the users input, runs that query in the background, adds the results to a created array, loops through the array writing each value to a data.csv file, and finally displaying the results in a table on the webpage.}
