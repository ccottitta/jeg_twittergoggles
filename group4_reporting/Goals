Reviewing Visualization/Reporting Collaboration

Visualization looks very clean and effective.

Visualization needs us to generate data.tsv file using queries to then be displayed.

Graphs need values to display intervals.

Our queries must be limited to allow transfer time to be reasonable.

We need to include user input (form) to generate queries. Include what hashtags to use.

Needs to display Job ID, count, and Name.

Proposed Changes:

-Filter by Job ID
-Output Job CSV 
-Input takes string of job ID's, so you can specify. Perhaps comma separated string.
